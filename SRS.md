\# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for E-Learning Web App

\#\# 1\. Introduction  
\#\#\# 1.1 Purpose  
This document outlines the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for an \*\*E-Learning Web Application\*\* that allows students from \*\*Class 3 to Class 12\*\* to enroll in courses, make payments, and access learning materials. The system will support three user roles: \*\*Students, Teachers, and Admins\*\*. The application will be scalable, starting with a basic version and iteratively adding new features over time.

\#\#\# 1.2 Scope  
The initial version (MVP \- Minimum Viable Product) will include:  
\- User authentication & role management  
\- Course selection & enrollment  
\- Payment processing  
\- Basic user dashboards  
\- Scalable architecture for future expansions

The application will be a \*\*web-based platform\*\* with the backend built in \*\*Spring Boot\*\* and the frontend in \*\*React\*\*.

\#\# 2\. Functional Requirements  
\#\#\# 2.1 User Roles & Authentication  
\- \*\*Students:\*\* Can sign up, browse courses, enroll, make payments, and track progress.  
\- \*\*Teachers:\*\* Can create/manage courses (future phase), view enrolled students.  
\- \*\*Admins:\*\* Oversee platform operations, manage users, and handle payments.  
\- \*\*Authentication:\*\* Users will sign up via \*\*email/password & social logins\*\* (Google, Facebook).

\#\#\# 2.2 Course Management  
\- Initially, courses will be \*\*pre-defined\*\* and managed by admins.  
\- Future versions will allow teachers to \*\*upload & manage courses\*\*.  
\- Courses will contain \*\*videos, PDFs, quizzes (later phase)\*\*.

\#\#\# 2.3 Payment Processing  
\- Students must \*\*pay to access courses\*\*.  
\- Supported payment gateways: \*\*Razorpay, Stripe, PayPal\*\*.  
\- Future enhancements: \*\*Discounts, coupons, referral programs\*\*.

\#\#\# 2.4 User Dashboards  
\- \*\*Student Dashboard:\*\* Enrolled courses, progress tracking.  
\- \*\*Teacher Dashboard:\*\* Course management (future phase).  
\- \*\*Admin Dashboard:\*\* User & payment management.

\#\#\# 2.5 Scalability & Future Enhancements  
\- \*\*Phase 2:\*\* Live classes, discussion forums, AI recommendations.  
\- \*\*Phase 3:\*\* Mobile app, gamification, advanced analytics.

\#\# 3\. Non-Functional Requirements  
\#\#\# 3.1 Scalability  
\- The system will be designed with a \*\*microservices architecture\*\* to support future growth.

\#\#\# 3.2 Security  
\- \*\*JWT authentication\*\* for API security.  
\- \*\*GDPR compliance\*\* for data protection.

\#\#\# 3.3 Performance  
\- The app will be optimized for fast \*\*loading & responsiveness\*\*.

\#\#\# 3.4 Deployment  
\- Hosting options: \*\*AWS / DigitalOcean\*\*.  
\- Database: \*\*PostgreSQL / MySQL\*\*.

\#\# 4\. Development & Deployment Plan  
\- \*\*MVP Delivery:\*\* Basic version within \*\*X weeks\*\*.  
\- \*\*Iterative Updates:\*\* New features every \*\*X months\*\*.  
\- \*\*Beta Testing:\*\* Conducted before full launch.

\#\# 5\. Conclusion  
This document serves as the blueprint for developing the E-Learning Web App. The focus is on \*\*building a scalable MVP\*\* and continuously adding new features to enhance the learning experience.
